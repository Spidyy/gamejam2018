				<text>Leaving the shrine be, you go to walk away but are held in place by an invisible force. Taunting laughter booms from the shrine. "Foolish mortal. You must know your place in this world". With the last word uttered, you feel life itself draining out of your body, leaving you a feeble heap on the ground for a few moments.</text>
