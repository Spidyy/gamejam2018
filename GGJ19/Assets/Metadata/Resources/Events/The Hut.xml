				<text>Stammering, you warmly address the witch. She neutrally greets you back, eyeing you up and down. "Hmm...no, you're no good. Go on, be off with you" dismissively calls after a moment, waddling off into her hut. No good for what you wonder?</text>

				<text>Unsure of how to react, you apologise for skulking. The witch nods and begins walking towards you. As she closes in, she briefly lays a hand on you, causing you to feel slightly dizzy. Once your head clears, you realise the witch and hut are nowhere to be seen.</text>
